            As 2019 comes to an end and a new decade approaches, we look back at all the important Earth science NASA has revealed. This is a time to take stock in all that we have learned and to use those insights to better
           understand and reliably predict the many ways our planet is changing in the coming decades.

      Climate Action in the 2020s: Three Steps to Reducing Value Chain Emissions
    </h2>
    
<div class="blogcontent">
    <h3>1. Focus on GHG Reduction Potential</h3>
    
          <div class="textcontent">
             <p>
        Businesses aiming to reduce their Scope 3 emissions should start with a thorough understanding of their value chains and identify the areas with the greatest potential to deliver GHG reductions. This is an essential step—the greatest GHG reduction potential
         may not be the most obvious. Simply because a value chain may be the largest (e.g. by spend) or be the most GHG intensive (e.g. large agricultural commodities such as cotton for apparel, in some specific location), these may not have the most potential for reduction since they might already be optimized.
      </p>
          </div>
        
      <h3>2. Use a “Reverse Sourcing” Approach</h3>

      
          <div  class="textcontent">
            <p>
              A traditional sourcing approach calls for engaging Tier 1 suppliers, then working with them to engage their supply chains. This approach, while systematic, doesn’t prioritize the specific value chain players with the greatest emissions reduction potential.
      
              To most effectively reduce GHG emissions, companies can apply a ‘reverse sourcing’ approach. This means targeting GHG reduction solutions at the root, rather than focusing on Tier 1 suppliers as an entry point. Depending on value chain specificities, businesses can identify value chain players, such as smallholder
               producers, upstream producers, manufacturers or others with the largest GHG reduction potential, beyond Tier 1. And therefore, target and implement actions to significantly reduce GHG emissions at that level.
            </p>
            

          </div>

        3. Take Pilot Programs to Scale
